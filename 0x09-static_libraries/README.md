# Static libraries

Project done during **Full Stack Software Engineering** at **ALX School**. It aims to learn how to debug in **C language**.

## Technologies
* C files are compiled using `gcc version 11.2.0` 
* C files are written according to the C90 standard
* Tested on Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS

## Files
All of the following files are programs written in C:

| Filename | Description |
| -------- | ----------- |
| `libmy.a` | Static library that contains a lot of functions |
| `create_static_lib.sh` | Script that creates a static library called `liball.a` from all the `.c` files that are in the current directory |
